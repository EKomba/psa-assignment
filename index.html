            Texting diverts your attention away from the road, increasing the
            risk of accidents. When you're focused on your phone, you may not
            notice important cues, such as a sudden stop or a pedestrian
            crossing the road. When you're texting, your reaction time to
            unexpected events on the road is significantly delayed. Split-second
            decisions can be the difference between avoiding an accident and
            being involved in one.

        <h2>Injury and Loss of Life</h2>
        <p class="injury__p">
          Texting-related accidents often result in serious injuries and
          fatalities. Lives can be forever changed due to a momentary
          distraction. Many countries and states have strict laws against using
          a phone while driving. If caught, you can face fines, license
          suspension, and even jail time.
        </p>
        <h2>Setting an Example</h2>
        <p class="injury__p">
          If you're a parent or a role model, texting and driving sets a
          dangerous example for younger drivers. It's essential to promote safe
          driving habits among family and friends. Choosing not to text and
          drive provides peace of mind. You can focus on the road and arrive at
          your destination safely, knowing that you've taken responsible steps
          to protect yourself and others. great job idiot!
